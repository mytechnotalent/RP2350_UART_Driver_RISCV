/**
 * FILE: image_def.s
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * RP2350 IMAGE_DEF Block.
 * 
 * BRIEF:
 * A minimum amount of metadata (a valid IMAGE_DEF block) must be embedded in any
 * binary for the bootrom to recognise it as a valid program image, as opposed to,
 * for example, blank flash contents or a disconnected flash device. This must
 * appear within the first 4 kB of a flash image, or anywhere in a RAM or OTP image.
 * Unlike RP2040, there is no requirement for flash binaries to have a checksummed
 * "boot2" flash setup function at flash address 0. The RP2350 bootrom performs a
 * simple best‑effort XIP setup during flash scanning, and a flash‑resident program
 * can continue executing in this state, or can choose to reconfigure the QSPI
 * interface at a later time for best performance.
